## About

The first idea about creating such a website arose around September 2023. At that time, I only focused on searching for prefixes. I worked on the project for less than a month, the search engine worked, but it still wasn't the same. I used the search engine without other changes occasionally during contest at HF.

I returned to the whole project in mid-July 2024. I rebuilt the entire search engine code from the ground up. Over time I added new features and it was no longer just about prefix searches, and after less than a month this website was created.

After one year of operation, in July 2025, the website underwent a major update. The most significant changes include a new unified design and a complete reorganization of the code, taking advantage of modern PHP capabilities. In addition, minor bugs were fixed, and the QSO map was removed from the site, which I plan to completely redesign soon. At the same time, I am preparing new features that will expand and enhance the website.

For easier reference to the original version of AMARADIO.eu, see [Tag v1](https://github.com/ondrahladik/AmaRadio.eu/releases/tag/v1). 

## Function

<b>Prefix search</b> - Find country, region, and information by callsign.  
<b>Locator map</b> - Search or compare the distance between two locators.  
<b>Zone maps</b> - View locators or ITU, CQ, and time zones on the map.  
<b>Time</b> - View the current time, for example, for logging QSO.

The following features are available on AMARADIO.eu but are not part of this repository.   
<b>CTU database</b> - Search for radio amateurs in the czech CTU database.
