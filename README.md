## About

The first idea about creating such a website arose around September 2023. At that time, I only focused on searching for prefixes. I worked on the project for less than a month, the search engine worked, but it still wasn't the same. I used the search engine without other changes occasionally during contest at HF.

I returned to the whole project in mid-July 2024. I rebuilt the entire search engine code from the ground up. Over time I added new features and it was no longer just about prefix searches, and after less than a month this website was created.
